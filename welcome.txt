Welcome to kpritz. Kpritz is a fast reading app with a strong focus on
ease of use and customizability.

To use kpritz is easy. The first thing you want to do is to press the
"play" button to go forward. The text flows as long as you keep the
button pressed, pausing is as easy as releasing it! You can also go to
previous or next word or to previous or next sentence, with the buttons
left and right of "play".

To open a text to read, press the leftmost button at the bottom of your
interface, this will bring you to a menu allowing to select from a
variety of sources. Among them, you can select from internal memory or
directly from recent readings. Kpritz keep your last position in a file
for next opening.

You can change the reading speed uring the "plus" and "minus" buttons,
the current speed is indicated aside these buttons.

The rightmost buttons allows configuring the application. A lot of
things can be configured, text size, color, and the default path to open
when browsing for a document.

Kpritz is able to read multiple type of documets, currently flat text,
epub and html are supported. More sources are planned to be added soon.
